	Execution for the first time		
		roscore &	
			
	Open 2 terminals: one for the publisher, another one for the subscriber

Question 1.	
	ROS C++ is faster than ROS python which has been demonstrated below.
	
Question 1. A.	
	As analyzed in the “ROS publisher-subscriber performance.xslx” file, the measured values are different from the real values for publisher frequency rates above 100 Hz.
	
Question 1. B.	
	The performance difference of different Publisher/Subscriber combinations are commented in “ROS publisher-subscriber performance.xslx” file.
	
Question 1. C.	
	roscpp is a library written in C++ which is a low level language thus it performs better as the executing code is compiled into binary code.
	rospy is a library written in Python which is a high level language thus its performance is lower as compared to C++. So it can only be used to make prototypes.
